# Everything-about-Neural-Network
Here you will get **Theoretical and Practical** implementation of the basic of **Neural Network to L-Layer neural network**

## Basic of Neural Network:

- First question come to our mind is **What is a neural network ?**

  - Neural Network is a collection of the neurons with 1 or many layers.
And each neuron is like a **function of input** which do some calculation on the input and give the output.
