# Everything-about-Neural-Networks
Here you will get **Theoretical and Practical** implementation of the basic of **Neural Network to L-Layer neural network**

## Basic of Neural Network:

- First question come to our mind is **What is a neural network ?**

  - As we know that **Neural Network** is a collection of the neurons with **1 or many layers.**
And each neuron is like a **function of input** which do some calculation on the input and give the output.

- Now we try to get it with famous analogy of ** neuron of the brain and artifical neurons **
